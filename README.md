## Utech Advance Programming Languages
### Sumemer 2024

# Instructions :

Design a programming language that performs the same functions as impure simplified Lambda Calculus. When a program written in this language is run (i.e. an expression is evaluated), it should display which reductions are being done until the program/expression is in normal form. The program should interface with a large language (LLM) model like OpenAI, ChatGPT or Google Bard, etc., to provide additional information to the user on the transformations taking place. The language should demonstrate at least 2 characteristics of a good programming language that you have studied in this class. This project requires developing a new programming language based on Lambda Calculus to build a compiler or interpreter for your language.

##### Requirements:
- Your language must perform lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis, and must incorporate the results of the semantic analysis into the core logic of your compiler/interpreter, and allow the resulting target code to be executed.

- Your programming language must feature at least two (2) of the characteristics of a
good programming language. 

- The grammar of your language can be specified in regular CFG, BNF, EBNF, or PEG formats. You are free to use any development language of your choice
and you may also use compiler development tools such as LEX/YACC (generates C code), FLEX/BISON (generates C/C++ code), JLEX/CUP (generates Java code), Jack (generates Java code), PLY (generates Python code), or similar tools.
